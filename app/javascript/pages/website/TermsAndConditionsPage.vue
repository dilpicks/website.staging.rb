            Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach

            appointment shall be made by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration

            provisional measures ordered by the arbitrator may be specifically enforced by any court

            arbitrator to act as amiable compositeurs or to proceed ex aequo et bono. Each party
            hereto retains the right to seek interim measures from a judicial authority, and any
            such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a
            waiver of the right to arbitrate. The arbitrator shall award the prevailing party, if
            any as determined by the arbitrator, its reasonable costs, including reasonable
            attorney’s fees. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
            court of competent jurisdiction. No information concerning an arbitration, beyond the
            names of the parties, their counsel or the relief requested, may be unilaterally

            confidential by any party whose access to such evidence arises exclusively because of
            its participation in the arbitration and shall not be disclosed to any third party
            (other than a witness or expert), except as may be required by law. Any party who
            commences any judicial proceeding in connection with an arbitration initiated hereunder
            shall endeavor to have the judicial record of any such proceeding sealed to the extent
            permitted by law.
