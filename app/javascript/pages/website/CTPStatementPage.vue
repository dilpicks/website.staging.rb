          <h3 class="h3">CPT Statement & Profile Policy</h3>
          <h5 class="h5">CPT Codes</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            The CPT codes included in this publication are in accordance with Current Procedural
            Terminology, a publication of the American Medical Association. CPT codes are provided
            here for the convenience of our clients; however, correct coding often varies from one
            carrier to another, and renegade.bio may bill specific carriers using codes other than
            those shown. Clients who bill for services should verify the code(s) with the applicable
            payer to confirm that their use is appropriate in each case.
          </p>

          <h5 class="h5">Profile Policy</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            Renegade.bioâ€™s policy is to provide physicians, in each instance, with the flexibility
            to choose appropriate tests for the individual patient, including the convenience of
            ordering test combinations/profiles. This flexibility does not distance physicians from
            making deliberate decisions regarding which tests are medically necessary. In addition,
            the physician should only order those tests that he or she believes are medically
            necessary for each patient, and a lesser inclusive profile or individual tests should be
            ordered if not all tests in the test combination/profile are medically necessary.
          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            All tests offered in test combinations/profiles may be ordered separately using the
            renegade.bio Portal. Renegade.bio encourages clients to contact their renegade.bio
            Account Manager if the testing configurations shown here do not meet individual needs
            for any reason, or if some other combination of procedures is needed.
          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            In an effort to keep our clients fully informed of the content, charges, and CPT codes
            included in its test combinations/profiles when billed to Medicare or other third-party
            payers, renegade.bio periodically sends notices concerning customized chemistry test
            combinations/profiles.
          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            <strong>
              Please remember that (1) when ordering tests for which Medicare or Medicaid
              reimbursement is sought, the physician should only order those tests that the
              physician believes are medically necessary for each patient, (2) that using a
              customized profile may result in ordering tests for which Medicare or Medicaid will
              deny payment, (3) that the physician should only order individual tests or a less
              inclusive profile where not all the tests in the customized test combination/profile
              are medically necessary for an individual patient, and (4) that the United States
              Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, takes the
              position that a physician who orders medically unnecessary tests may be subject to
              civil penalties.
            </strong>

          <h5 class="h5">Investigational Procedures</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            Some of the individual tests and profile test components listed in this
            <em>Directory</em> may be considered by Medicare or other insurance carriers as
            investigational procedures, and therefore, the test may not be payable by the carrier as
            a covered benefit for the patient. Medicare patients must be informed of this
            possibility when the physician orders tests that may fall into this category. Affected
            patients must be asked to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice, agreeing to be financially
            responsible if the service is denied by the carrier. Additionally, for other insurance
            plans, physicians should inform the patient that the service(s) may not be covered by
            their private insurance plan and, if so, they will be financially responsible for
            payment. If the patient declines to accept financial responsibility, please do not order
            the test(s).
          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            As with all clinical assays, results of these tests should be used only in conjunction
            with other medically established diagnostic elements (eg, symptoms, history, clinical
            impressions, results from other tests, etc). Physicians should use all the information
            available to them to diagnose and determine appropriate treatment for their patients. In
            order to obtain a current list of the procedures that may be considered investigational
            by Medicare or other insurance carriers, please contact your Account Manager.
