            hard drive. Cookies ensure that this Site’s content is presented in the most effective
            manner for you and your computer. For a complete list, see the

          <p class="p4">
            These cookies collect anonymous information on how people use this Site. For example, we
            may use Google Analytics cookies to help us understand how individuals arrive at this
            Site, browse or use this Site, and highlight areas where we can improve such as
            navigation and marketing. The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details
            from which your individual identity can be established.
          </p>

          <h5 class="h5">Functionality Cookies</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit this
            Site, language, and search parameters. These can then be used to provide you with an
            experience more appropriate to your selections and to make the visits more tailored. The

          <h5 class="h5">Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make
            advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
            number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of
            an advertising campaign. The cookies are usually placed by third party advertising
            networks. They remember the websites you visit, and that information is shared with
            other parties such as advertisers.
          </p>

          <h5 class="h5">Social Media Cookies</h5>
          <p class="p4">
            These cookies allow you to share what you have been doing on this Site on social media,
            such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control and are therefore

          <p class="p4">
            We may use different kinds of cookies, including session ID cookies and persistent
            cookies. Session ID cookies are used to personalize your user experience, and to
            determine ways to improve this Site and the products and services we offer. These
            cookies are deleted when you close your browser session. Persistent cookies are used to
            collect information such as IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP),

          </p>

          <p class="p4">
            Many web browsers allow for the use of a “Do Not Track” function to inform websites that
            you do not want your online activities tracked. Currently, we do not track your or any
            other users’ Personal Information over time and across third party websites. We
            therefore do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.

            disclosed certain Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. We do not share
            Personal Information with other people or non-affiliated businesses for their direct
            marketing purposes. We are only required to respond to a customer request once during
            any calendar year. To make such a request you should send a letter to RenegadeXBio, PBC,
