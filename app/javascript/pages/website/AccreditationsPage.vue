            The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations include
            federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens
            for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. The CDC, in partnership
            with CMS and FDA, supports the CLIA program and clinical laboratory quality.

            CAP accredits laboratories perform tests using methodologies and clinical application
            within the expertise of the College of American Pathologist program. Laboratories must
            be appropriately licensed to perform testing when required by law. CAP accreditation
            meets or exceeds requirements from CLIA, FDA and OSHA, strengthening patient care and
            safety.
