Even if you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated, you <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/you-can-still-spread-develop-covid-19-after-getting-a-vaccine-what-to-know">can still unwittingly spread the virus</a>, which is why officials continue to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html">advise against travel</a>.</p><p class="p4">Nevertheless, we acknowledge essential travel and recognize that some are risk takers. But if you <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.flysfo.com/travel-well">must travel</a>, we want you to know how to do so safely. In this article, we will provide tips on how to fly as safely as possible in the time of COVID.</p><h3 class="h3">If you must travel in the time of COVID</h3><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Know the risks.</strong> While there are some <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/flying-planes-coronavirus-safe">concerns about the science</a>, experts say that flying, in and of itself, is fairly low risk. Variables include the length of the flight, how closely people are packed, and your own in-flight COVID practices.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Do your research.</strong> Many <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/travel/covid-travel-requirements">states and countries have travel requirements</a> requiring travelers to provide a negative COVID test report before departure. <strong>Non-compliance may result in being denied boarding or entry, or facing mandatory quarantine on arrival,</strong> so be sure to know the rules before you go.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Shift to an off-peak time.</strong> If you can be flexible, consider shifting to a week when there won&rsquo;t be so many other people crowding into airports, planes, and other indoor spaces.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Drive instead of fly.</strong> Driving typically takes longer, but you&rsquo;ll spend less time in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/travel/covid-travel-requirements">close proximity to others</a>. Pack food to minimize stops, and use good COVID hygiene at gas and rest stops. If you do have to stop for the night, either sleep in the car or look for a motel with rooms that open directly to the outdoors.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Pick your airline and your seat.</strong> If flying is the only way to go, book one of the airlines that is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/drive-fly-safe-covid/">blocking middle seats</a> for greater distance between passengers. Look for a seat towards the front of the plane, where you can get on and off the plane quickly, or a window seat, which gives you a little more distance from people moving up and down the aisle.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Skip the lines.</strong> Sign up for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/airline-social-distancing-policies/">TSA PreCheck</a> to avoid long security lines.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Isolate ahead of time.</strong> If you can&rsquo;t get tested, one way to lower risk is to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html">isolate for 10 days</a> before your trip. This helps ensure that if you do have an asymptomatic infection, it will have passed the contagious stage by the time you leave.<br>Remember, isolation means not leaving the house and having food and other necessities delivered. It means avoiding all proximity to others—including household members, unless they too are isolating.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">Get tested for travel</h3><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/get-the-right-test-at-the-right-time"><strong>Get the right test.</strong></a> Most destinations that require a pre-travel COVID test specify that it must be a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/diagnostic-testing/about-our-nasal-pcr-covid-test">qRT-PCR test</a> from an approved laboratory, conducted within a specific time window, typically 72 hours. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/ask-a-scientist/why-qpcr-is-the-gold-standard-for-covid-19-testing/">This type of test is highly accurate</a>, with samples typically collected via throat or nasal swab.</p><p class="p4">The faster but less accurate antigen tests or home test kits typically do not fulfill travel requirements. Neither do <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>, which show whether you&rsquo;ve developed an immune response to COVID in the past.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Find out where to get tested.</strong> Look for a location that offers <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/diagnostic-testing/covid-19-travel-testing">rapid, affordable COVID testing</a>.<br></p></li></ul><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Get your <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/get-the-right-test-at-the-right-time">timing right</a>.</strong> The qRT-PCR test, which is highly accurate as a general rule, does have a higher rate of false negatives during the seven days right after infection.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">Take precautions with air travel</h3><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Pack protective gear, enough for the entire trip.</strong> Be sure to bring multiple face masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes. You&rsquo;ll want to wear a double mask, or better yet, an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks">N95 mask</a>, which protects better against aerosols than cloth. Be sure to keep your mask on at all times except when you&rsquo;re eating or drinking.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Wash your hands.</strong> Take every opportunity while traveling to wash or sanitize your hands.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Bring your own provisions.</strong> To minimize contact, be sure to bring your own food and a water bottle to fill once you get through security. Either refrain from eating or drinking on the plane, or put your mask back on right away afterwards.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Use airport restrooms if possible.</strong> The larger, better ventilated rest rooms in the airport are easier to navigate safely when you need to powder your nose or clean your hands than the tiny cramped ones on the plane.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Wipe down surfaces.</strong> Although the CDC says that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">surfaces are not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads,</a> you may still want to wipe down surfaces that you can&rsquo;t avoid touching, including seat controls, tray table, and bathroom knobs, just to be extra careful.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Stay put.</strong> Avoid moving around on the plane to keep contact with other passengers to a minimum.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Use your ventilation.</strong> Direct the overhead air vent nozzle towards your face to help keep air circulating around you.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Traveling during COVID-19 can entail a few curveballs. Plan for delays and cancellations.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">Take precautions once you get there</h3><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Stay on your COVID game.</strong> Once you arrive at your location, continue to take standard precautions: wear masks, wash hands, keep your distance, and gather in large, well-ventilated spaces.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget about the return trip.</strong> If you&rsquo;re away for more than a few days, you may need to go through testing and/or quarantine when you return.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">Forgoing travel plans is just one more sacrifice demanded by a pandemic that has already taken so much. Right now staying home is one of the biggest things we can do to protect both the ones we love and society as a whole. But if you must travel, keeping these tips in mind can help lessen the risk.</p></div>' }

According to researchers, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3320">pregnant women with COVID-19</a> admitted to hospitals are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or need invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.</p><p class="p4">Additional research suggests they are also more likely to have a premature birth (earlier than 37 weeks), <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655#:~:text=Cesarean%20delivery%20(C%2Dsection),birth%20after%20cesarean%20(VBAC).">cesarean delivery</a> (C-section), and their babies are more likely to be <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3320">admitted to a neonatal unit</a>. There may also be an increased risk for other poor outcomes, such as pregnancy loss, when comparing pregnancy to people without COVID-19.

Since then, there have been a number of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html">types of vaccines</a> developed. The current methodology behind the available COVID-19 vaccines are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html">messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines</a> (Pfizer, Moderna) and viral vector vaccines (J&J). Viral vector vaccines have been previously utilized, but mRNA vaccines are a newer technology first employed for SARS-CoV-2.

The thought of a house full of family and friends and warmth and good smells is so enticing right now.</p><p class="p4">But with COVID spiking and states going back into lockdown from sea to shining sea, it&rsquo;s time to face the sad truth: <strong>there is no safe and socially responsible way to gather with those outside of our pods right now.</strong></p><p class="p4">As tempting as it is to try and come up with some bargain that will make it OK—We&rsquo;ll keep all the windows open! We&rsquo;ll hold our breaths when we hug!—we need to be honest with ourselves about the likelihood of holding those boundaries once we&rsquo;re all together celebrating. Add in kids, alcohol, and the jovial chaos of the holiday, and the chances of maintaining good COVID practices drop sharply, no matter how good our intentions may be.</p><p class="p4">In short: this whole situation sucks, in so very many ways, and it&rsquo;s natural to feel sad about it.</p><p class="p4">But as you move through the disappointment and begin to embrace the reality that Thanksgiving 2020 is not going to be like Thanksgivings of the past, you might begin to feel a hint of relief. A year off from all the labor and stress of the traditional meal is also a reprieve and a chance to reset.</p><p class="p4">As you let go of the idea of the big dinner, curiosity stirs: what could it be like to celebrate this most traditional of holidays in a fresh way?</p><p class="p4">Here are some ideas for making this Thanksgiving in a time of COVID as meaningful, enjoyable, and safe as possible for yourself and your family.</p><h3 class="h3">Remote Thanksgiving activities during the COVID-19 pandemic</h3><p class="p4">There&rsquo;s no denying that online is the safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving. And despite the fact that so many of us are totally Zoomed out, there are still ways to make a virtual celebration an enjoyable one.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Cook together.</strong> A lot of Thanksgiving fun happens in the kitchen, with different generations preparing cherished family recipes.</p><p class="p4">During the days before the holiday or on the morning of the day itself, why not have a group Zoom where you make Mom&rsquo;s oyster dressing together, or ask the family master baker to show everyone how to make a pumpkin pie. Be sure to send everyone the recipe ahead of time so they can gather the ingredients.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Eat and give thanks together.</strong> Preparing the same menu helps bring everyone together. So can making a place at the table for a laptop or tablet running Zoom for a virtual dinner. Take time at the start to focus on the reason for the season, which is gratitude for all the good things in life.</p><p class="p4">Unstructured group video calls can be loud and overwhelming, so plan some light structure, like this:</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Play a game together.</strong> After dinner, you and the fam can hold a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://teambuilding.com/blog/virtual-scavenger-hunt#standard">virtual scavenger hunt,</a> where each team has to find objects from a list within the house.

But a lot of local restaurants (especially Black- and immigrant-owned ones) are struggling right now. One of them would probably be happy to receive a take-out order for your family&rsquo;s Thanksgiving dinner.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Reach out to friends.</strong> You probably know people who live alone and on a shoestring. Pack that turkey dinner into to-go boxes and deliver it to their doorsteps, or spend part of the day calling friends who are home alone.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Take it to the streets.</strong> If you have a lot of unhoused neighbors where you live, consider delivering (in a socially distanced way) a hot holiday meal to folks on the streets. Or if you&rsquo;re more risk tolerant, mask up and help serve at a local shelter or free meal program to nourish bodies and soul at the same time.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Volunteer online.</strong> Even on Thanksgiving, there are a lot of ways to volunteer virtually.

If this resonates for you and your family, take actions like these:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Learn the real history.</strong> Start out by finding out about the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://native-land.ca/">original peoples</a> of the place where you live. Remember that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://native-land.ca/">indigenous people are still here</a>, and that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mmiwusa.org/">violence against them</a> is still happening.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Include a land acknowledgement.</strong> A <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mmiwusa.org/">land acknowledgment</a> is a brief statement acknowledging that an event is taking place on lands traditionally stewarded by indigenous peoples (name the tribes), and expressing respect to those peoples and their elders, past, present, and future.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Focus on traditional foods.</strong> Find ways to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/indigenous-land-acknowledgement-explained">feature traditional local foods in your Thanksgiving meal</a>—for example, a side dish with corn, beans, and squash. This sacred trio, called the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a8axe/how-to-decolonize-your-thanksgiving-dinner">Three Sisters</a>, is traditional across much of what is now called the southern United States.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Give thanks with an Iroquois prayer.</strong> The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://americanindian.si.edu/environment/pdf/01_02_Thanksgiving_Address.pdf">Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address</a> is a great prayer of thanks to all parts of the living world.

Invite folks to read it aloud at dinner in a call-and-response way, repeating <q>Now our minds are one</q> at the end of each section.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Make reparations.</strong> This is an extremely appropriate time of year for donations to local indigenous organizations. You can pass the hat or hold a raffle, auction, or other fundraiser to give back to the original residents of the place you call home.

Don&rsquo;t drop these practices just because you&rsquo;re with the fam.</p><p class="p4">Ask everyone to distance and stay masked unless they&rsquo;re eating or drinking, and to wash hands or sanitize frequently.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Isolate and get tested.</strong> Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s already too late to minimize risk of exposure by isolating for 14 days prior to the holiday. But you can still isolate for five to seven days, then <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.testthepeople.org/">get a highly accurate PCR test</a> to confirm you&rsquo;re not carrying the virus before gathering with your relatives. Be sure to continue isolating from the time you take the test until the gathering.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">Despite the tough choices we are all having to make right now, there&rsquo;s still a lot to be grateful for. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03248-7">Recent good news about vaccines</a> gives reason for hope that next year will be better. Remember that by choosing to forgo gathering in person, we&rsquo;re helping make sure that everyone will still be around for Thanksgiving next year.</p></div>' }

These <q>long haul</q> cases might host the virus long enough and lack the antibodies to put up a strong enough defense thereby developing new strains. That being said, the largest contributor towards viral mutation is the sheer number of people infected. The more people are infected and the longer they are infected, the more opportunity the virus has to evolve. This is why it is imperative we understand the new variants, how they spread and how different they are from the original recipe.</p><h3 class="h3" id="meet-the-new-mutants">Meet the new mutants</h3><p class="p4">What makes the variants concerning is not where they come from, but the mutations they contain. Small changes in the structure of the virus, like say the alteration of a certain spike protein, can make the virus bind more easily to the host body. Currently we are keeping an eye on these <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html">notable variants of COVID-19</a>.</p><h3 class="h3" id="omicron">Omicron (B.1.1.529)</h3><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Has now been detected in at least 110 countries, and all 50 states.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Omicron seems to be more transmissible than the other variants.

The main concern with these variants is how they might change the speed of infection, prolong the length of illness and help the virus stay alive outside of the body for longer. Bottom line if it spreads it gets stronger.</p><figure><div class="image-container"><img alt="CoVariants: SARS-CoV-2 Mutations and Variants of Interest in USA March 2020 to November 2021" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/renegade-bio/image/upload/newsroom/publications/covid-variants/covid-variants-sept-2021.png" width="1068" height="638" title="Source: Emma B.

Variants and vaccines are in a race where one seeks to slow infection and the other wants to spread like wildfire.</p><p class="p4">Lowering transmission is key. Fewer infections mean less opportunity for the virus to evolve and mutate. We achieve fewer infections by vaccinating as many people as we can swiftly while maintaining a strong prevention practice. Last year we rushed to flatten the curve of new infections, now we want to flatten the curve of new variants.</p><p class="p4">There is concern that the Beta variant will reduce the efficacy of vaccinations. With the Gamma strain more studies are needed to understand how it makes itself unrecognizable by antibodies. Without an antibody response we could become even more infectious because our bodies defense system has no idea a dangerous new threat just moved in.</p><p class="p4">The good news is that vaccines are highly effective at reducing the severity of illness even among the variant strains. Vaccines can also be updated and adjusted. We could be a booster away from highly effective protection.</p><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">COVID-19, like all viruses mutate using our bodies as incubation stations. With every new infection the virus uses our genetic code to alter its own before passing itself off via droplets. Variants are created by viral mutations which are small errors in the code. The largest factor in the creation of new variants is the massive amount of infections happening globally. To reduce the amount of new infections and increase the likelihood the vaccines we have will be the best defense against it, we need to get vaccinated and fast! Until then we need to up our game with PPE, and take care of ourselves and our communities. Ultimately, we want to thank you for being brave amidst uncertainty and most certainly encourage you to stay home if you&rsquo;re sick and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.testthepeople.org">get tested</a>!</p></div>' }

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><h3 class="h3">Abstract</h3><p class="p4">This paper describes an automated, self-administered SalivaDirect<sup>&trade;</sup> protocol that decentralizes sample collection and streamlines lab processing to reduce costs of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p class="p4">It presents the results of a research study to compare the costs and accuracy of a manual, staff-collected protocol (as specified in the SalivaDirect FDA Emergency Use Authorization), with an automated, self-administered protocol, which eliminates the need for medical collection staff and streamlines processing in the lab.</p><p class="p4">The data indicate that this protocol reduces the internal cost per test by 42% for our end-to-end testing services, with high degrees of sensitivity, specificity, and concordance with the CDC assay.</p><p class="p4">This significant cost savings suggests that wider implementation of such a decentralized protocol could help achieve health equity goals by lowering economic and logistical barriers to diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.</p><h3 class="h3">Purpose</h3><p class="p4">In March 2020, renegade.bio <sup><a href="#key-references">2</a></sup> formed as a Public Benefit Corporation to address the urgent need for diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, with the mission of making testing accessible to all. Since then, the company has worked to increase access by reducing PCR assay costs for organizations and individuals.</p><p class="p4">SalivaDirect <sup><a href="#key-references">3</a></sup> was developed at the Yale School of Public Health and brought to market by a decentralized network of clinical laboratories as a more affordable solution to the need for rapid, accurate diagnostic testing for COVID-19.</p><p class="p4">The SalivaDirect EUA <sup><a href="#key-references">4</a></sup> requires sample collection to be observed by trained medical personnel, which presents challenges for community-based testing. While reagent costs for SalivaDirect are markedly lower than traditional RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) methodologies, associated costs (overhead, laboratory staff, and sample collection staff) still present economic and logistical barriers to access.</p><p class="p4">renegade.bio&rsquo;s purpose in conducting this research was to validate the ability to lower the cost of collections through self-administration and automation, while retaining high degrees of sensitivity, specificity, and concordance with the CDC test.</p><h3 class="h3">Methods</h3><h4 class="h4">SalivaDirect Self-Collection Research Study</h4><p class="p4">To determine the effectiveness of individual self-collection of saliva samples, we conducted a 1,000+ person research study in a San Francisco Bay Area school district.</p><p class="p4">renegade.bio delivered kits to teachers and students, facilitated their registration through Primary.Health, and guided them through self-administration of the test with onscreen instructions, eliminating the need for medical collection staff.</p><p class="p4">Samples were then couriered to our CLIA-certified, high-complexity laboratory in Oakland, CA and processed within 24 hours.</p><h4 class="h4">Verification of SalivaDirect Protocols In-House</h4><p class="p4">To determine the efficacy of SalivaDirect in delivering consistent PCR results, we conducted a bridge study (n=28). We collected 14 positive and 14 negative samples, using three methods for each participant: anterior nares swabs, saliva samples collected via 5 mL polypropylene tube, and saliva samples collected via straw and 2mL Greiner tube.</p><p class="p4">Samples were accessioned by lab personnel and processed using the CDC assay on the swab samples for reporting to the patient and the state Department of Public Health. SalivaDirect manual and automated processes were also performed on the saliva samples for both positive and negative samples.</p><h4 class="h4">Self-Registration and Administration</h4><p class="p4">Over 8,000 teachers and students (n=8,311) were recruited from middle and high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. PCR collection kits were delivered to the community at the end of the day on Friday. After receiving their kits, individuals returned home and registered for a test through a custom web application hosted by Primary.Health.</p><p class="p4">Registrants were guided through step-by-step instructions on how to scan collection device barcodes to associate them with their account. Saliva was collected through a biodegradable straw into the collection vessel. Using a six-inch straw ensured that saliva did not contaminate the outside of the tube.</p><p class="p4">Self-collected samples were delivered by participants to an on-campus drop-off location. Samples were then couriered to the renegade.bio CLIA-certified laboratory in Oakland, CA. Samples were assessed through validated automated or manual processes, and results were reported to participants and the state within 24 hours samples were received.</p><h3 class="h3">Results</h3><h4 class="h4">SalivaDirect and CDC Concordance</h4><p class="p4">Validation of the SalivaDirect protocol led to a 96% concordance with the CDC test, and sensitivity and specificity were 92.86% and 100% respectively <a href="#table-1">(see Table 1)</a>. Though sample size was limited, the data indicate that the assay using self-collected samples is highly effective at detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nearly 100% of cases.</p><h4 class="h4">Registration and Administration Success Rates</h4><p class="p4">Participants were able to self-register their tests in the Primary.Health web application with a 100% success rate <a href="#table-2">(see Table 2)</a>. There were no reports of problems with the user registration workflow.</p><p class="p4">The rate at which participants were able to easily and successfully scan barcodes to associate them with their Primary.Health account was assessed. Participants were asked for subjective feedback, and the number of successful administrations occurring without intervention was counted. The total number of positive administrations was divided by the sample size (n) and multiplied by 100. The administration success rate was determined to be 94% <a href="#table-2">(see Table 2)</a>.</p><h4 class="h4">Manual vs. Automated Process</h4><p class="p4">To further validate our automation processes with self-administered samples, we evaluated the number of tests with an inconclusive result.</p><p class="p4">Out of 57 samples processed manually, two were inconclusive (98.2% success rate), while in the automated process, two out of 934 samples were inconclusive (99.7% success rate, see Table 2).</p><p class="p4">While the number of retests was higher than anticipated for the automated process (67/934), the vast majority of retested samples were reported to the patient within 24 hours.</p><h4 class="h4">Cost Reduction</h4><p class="p4">For manual, staff-administered SalivaDirect tests, renegade.bio targets a COGS (cost of goods sold) per test of around $16, including all non-reagent consumables. Personnel costs (including medical director, lab director, and clinical lab staff) increase the cost per test to about $74. Additional costs include third-party application integration and sample collection fees, insurance, rent, and other overhead. This adds up to a standardized and CMS-accepted cost per test of $100 <a href="#figure-1">(see Figure 1A)</a>.</p><p class="p4">By automating laboratory sample processing and decentralizing collection efforts, we were able to drive down renegade.bio costs by 42% <a href="#figure-1">(see Figure 1B)</a>.</p><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">In a change to the FDA-approved collection protocol for SalivaDirect, we found that saliva collection can be self-administered without reducing the accuracy of the test. Done from the comfort of home, self-administered saliva collection is a fast and easy process that could reduce the overall cost per test by $42.</p><p class="p4">While hurdles remain to the decentralization of collections, user-friendly web applications such as Primary.Health also help increase economic efficiencies of SalivaDirect.</p><p class="p4">Automated processes for SalivaDirect reduce the cost of laboratory operations and enhance throughput. Though the automated process in our study resulted in approximately 7.2% of retests, compared with 5.3% retests for the manual process, the efficiency of assay performance still allows for results in less than 12 hours and at a reduced cost (26%) per test. Retests were associated with viscosity of saliva samples and the ability to pipette with accuracy.</p><p class="p4">Transitioning to robotics systems could further enhance the economic efficiencies of SalivaDirect. Implementation of robotics systems is needed to achieve high throughput processing, but this requires an intensive review process by the FDA.</p><p class="p4">By eliminating the need for medical observation of pcr collections and automating laboratory processing for SalivaDirect testing, renegade.bio has developed a protocol that can significantly reduce testing costs, increasing equity by eliminating logistical and economic barriers to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.</p><h3 class="h3" id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3><p class="p4">We appreciate the valuable contributions of these colleagues at renegade.bio and Primary.Health:</p><ol><li><p class="p4">renegade.bio.

But a negative test result is NOT a <q>Get out of jail free</q> card. It is not a 100% guarantee that you are not infected with COVID.</p><p class="p4">That&rsquo;s because a diagnostic test is a snapshot of the past.

Production companies share these characteristics:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>Temporary:</strong> Event has a clear beginning, middle, and end.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Professional:</strong> Everyone is there to do a job.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Accountable:</strong> Organizers can require vaccination, testing, and other behavior from employees and vendors.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Intimate:</strong> Members have to work in close proximity, at times, without masks.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>Connected:</strong> Everyone can be contacted and tested before, during, and after entering the bubble.</p></li></ul><p class="p4">The overall strategy involves a combination of vaccination, questionnaires, and a double testing strategy.</p><h3 class="h3">Elements of risk mitigation for production companies</h3><h4 class="h4">Vaccination</h4><p class="p4">If everyone on set is vaccinated, then you won&rsquo;t need to quarantine. However, since vaccinated cast and crews are not yet mandatory per industry guidelines, testing is crucial.</p><h4 class="h4">Testing</h4><p class="p4">Using PCR testing, alongside proof of vaccination, can help eschew the majority of mask wearing on set. This fits well within a film and TV production where you have a set length of filming, there are different crews working closely together and wearing masks might not be possible.</p><p class="p4">Crew and cast can be swabbed in advance of call time. This gives the production team notice if someone is positive and the necessary time to make alternate arrangements. For more information about testing, see <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/articles/right-type-of-covid-19-test">our blog</a>.</p><h4 class="h4">Questionnaires</h4><p class="p4">Questionnaires are an additional tool to monitor cast and crew health. Participants can receive a questionnaire like the standard at the doctor: <q>Have you had a fever, chills, loss of smell or been exposed to someone with Covid recently?</q> The questionnaire&rsquo;s goal is to reinforce the importance of paying attention to your health and how it will affect the wellbeing of those around you.</p><h4 class="h4">Social distancing</h4><p class="p4">Encourage social distancing when appropriate and strives to establish expected behavior even when temporary.</p><h4 class="h4">Sanitation</h4><p class="p4">Provide sanitation, ventilation, masks as fundamental aspects of gathering.</p><h4 class="h4">Feedback & tracing</h4><p class="p4">Have post-event preparations for feedback to refine the process, follow up with potential outbreaks and accountability *</p><p class="p4">For high control scenario&rsquo;s your company&rsquo;s admin holds everyone&rsquo;s contact information and are empowered to contact trace in case of outbreak. Providing anonymous comment cards or digital feedback forms allow for the company to receive important information which will allow them to adjust for safety moving forward.</p><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">It is irresponsible to have an event without some sort of gatekeeping. With mandatory testing and vaccination check-ins, coupled with questionnaires upon entry, you can create a container where your crew and guests can feel secure. By doing everything you can to administer proper gatekeeping, social distancing, and sanitation, you are signaling that you care about the well-being of your guests and team.</p></div>' }

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><p class="p4">As if a global pandemic and the absence until recently of a national strategy for dealing with it wasn&rsquo;t enough to generate fear, uncertainty, and doubt, now we&rsquo;re hearing about exorbitant costs for COVID-19 testing.</p><p class="p4">Viral posts on social media claim costs as high as $2,315 to $3,000 per test. Some of these rumors have <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/covid-19-tests-dont-cost-over-3000/">been debunked</a>, but there is still reason for concern that the poor and uninsured are being slapped with surprise costs for COVID-19 testing.</p><p class="p4">The price of getting tested in America varies widely, depending on your location, insurance status, and coverage. By understanding your legal rights and doing some local research, you can often find more affordable options. In this article, we&rsquo;ll help you understand who pays for COVID-19 testing and how to access low-cost or free testing.</p><h3 class="h3">COVID Insurance Coverage</h3><p class="p4">Two pieces of legislature in 2020 were passed to help during this pandemic:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave">The Families First Coronavirus Response Act</a> (FFCRA) requires certain employers to provide their employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf">The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act</a> (CARES) was created to provide emergency assistance and health care response for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></li></ul><p class="p4">Both the FFCRA and the CARES Act require comprehensive private health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing without cost sharing to insured patients.</p><p class="p4">So your insurance company has to pay 100% of the cost of your COVID test—but only if COVID-19 infection is suspected due to symptoms or recent exposure to someone who has tested positive.</p><p class="p4">If this is the case for you, be sure to check with your insurer to confirm your coverage and find an in-network provider to order the test.</p><p class="p4">But if you&rsquo;re asymptomatic / not exposed (and you don&rsquo;t want to lie to your doctor about it), your insurance may not cover COVID testing, and you&rsquo;ll either need to pay out of pocket or find free testing. This includes testing for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/get-the-right-test-at-the-right-time">reasons like travel, visiting, or even return to work</a>.</p><h3 class="h3">Does your employer have to pay for a COVID test?</h3><p class="p4">When employees are asked to work under circumstances involving the risk of exposure, don&rsquo;t their employers have to pay for regular testing? Sadly, in America, the answer is no. And the short reasons are a) they don&rsquo;t have to, and b) in many cases, they can&rsquo;t afford to.</p><p class="p4">It&rsquo;s true that some employers do pay for regular testing of non-symptomatic people. Some workers, such as healthcare workers, government workers, sports teams, and some educators already get regular testing through their workplaces.</p><p class="p4">But there&rsquo;s no legal requirement that they do so. And because such testing is generally not covered by insurance, they must pay out of pocket to do so. And for the many small and medium businesses already struggling to survive in a pandemic economy, footing the bill for testing that&rsquo;s not deemed medically necessary is an impossible burden.</p><p class="p4">In fact, many employers actually have a disincentive to test employees, because finding a positive result means sending the infected person and everyone they&rsquo;ve been in contact with home—not to mention the costs of closing and disinfecting the space.</p><p class="p4">So many employers slide the responsibility and the cost of testing over to their workers. And this leaves many workers scrambling to find their own solutions for getting tested on the regular.</p><h3 class="h3">How much is a covid test without insurance?</h3><p class="p4">So if you aren&rsquo;t insured, or your insurance won&rsquo;t cover the testing you need, what to do? You can either find free testing, if it&rsquo;s accessible in your area, or pay for it out of pocket.</p><p class="p4">When comparing testing options, here are some questions to consider.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><strong>How soon can you get tested?</strong><br> Testing is usually a matter where time is of the essence. If the free test site takes a week for an appointment, you might need to pay out of pocket.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>What is the turnaround time for results?</strong><br> You need to be able to get <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/get-the-right-test-at-the-right-time">results within three days maximum</a>, and to isolate before and after testing for best results.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><strong>What kind of test is available?</strong><br> The gold standard of testing is the PCR test which tests for the virus in your system at that moment. Antibody tests are not able to diagnose current infection. To learn more about the different kinds of tests see this <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734">helpful blog that sums it up quite well</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">How to find low-cost and free covid testing</h3><h4 class="h4">Community testing</h4><p class="p4">Many cities and counties offer free and low-cost community testing, often without requiring symptoms or a doctor&rsquo;s referral. You may also be able to access <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://testthepeople.com">affordable next-day local testing</a> in your area.</p><p class="p4">Costs for community testing range from free to low cost. Some clinics will bill your insurance if you have it, while others charge a fee. Be sure to confirm the cost before making an appointment.</p><p class="p4">In California, you can <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">use this interactive map</a> to find testing near you. This map includes both free and for-cost options, so be sure to click through to the website for the testing location to confirm the cost.</p><p class="p4">You can also find information about community testing on the website for your county or state. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html">This page has a list of states</a>, with links to community clinics (called health centers) and each state&rsquo;s health department.</p><p class="p4">Here are some helpful sites to find community testing in the Bay Area:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://sf.gov/find-out-about-your-covid-19-testing-options">San Francisco</a></p></li><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://covid-19.acgov.org/testing.page">Alameda County</a></p></li></ul><h4 class="h4">Pharmacies</h4><p class="p4">Many pharmacies are now offering COVID-19 testing at select locations. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://corporate.walmart.com/covid19testing">Walmart</a> has partnered with the HHS to provide free and low-cost testing. RiteAid has partnered with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.projectbaseline.com">Project Baseline</a>, a testing initiative which offers free testing across the Northeast and West Coast.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">If you are not in California, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/#faqs">COVID-19 testing is available at no cost,</a> regardless of your health insurance status.</p></li><li><p class="p4">If you are in California, you will be asked to provide your health insurance information to schedule an appointment. Most health insurance plans will cover the full cost of testing, at no expense to you.</p></li></ul><p class="p4">Check in with your local pharmacy chain to see if you qualify for their free or low-cost program.</p><h3 class="h3">If you&rsquo;re paying out of pocket</h3><p class="p4">If you are willing to pay out of pocket, you have options at a range of prices and levels of service. </p><h4 class="h4">Urgent care centers</h4><p class="p4">"Doc in a box" clinics such as ZOOM+Care provide on-demand medical care on a fee-for-service model.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Cost for an office visit plus COVID test ranges from $175–250.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Lab cost may be billed separately from doctor visit.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Results are generally available in three to five days.</p></li></ul><h4 class="h4">At-home PCR testing</h4><p class="p4">Thankfully, the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html">Biden-Harris Administration</a> is now requiring insurance companies and group health plans to cover the cost of at-home COVID-19 tests. </p><p class="p4">At-home sample collection kits for PCR testing enable you to access a highly accurate PCR test from the safety and comfort of your home. Products like Pixel from LabCorp and LetsGetChecked involve collecting a sample with a nasal swab and sending it away to be analyzed.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Between shipping and results reporting times, the window for relevant and timely data may be smaller or the same, compared to traditional PCR testing.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Costs range from $100–150.</p></li><li><p class="p4">These are intended for use where COVID is suspected, so you may need to fill out a questionnaire or have a virtual chat with a doctor before you can receive the kit.</p></li><li><p class="p4">They typically promise results in two to three days once they receive your sample, so add on a couple of days for the mail.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Some companies can bill your insurance or, if you are uninsured, they can utilize federal funds to cover the cost on your behalf.</p></li></ul><h4 class="h4">At-home rapid testing</h4><p class="p4">These tests also involve collecting a sample at home, but instead of mailing it off to a lab, you see results within minutes via a color-changing indicator, like a home pregnancy test. While these <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02661-2">antigen tests are less sensitive and accurate</a> than PCR tests, many are hoping they can be a pandemic game-changer once widely available.</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Costs range from $30–50.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Results are available within minutes.</p></li><li><p class="p4">Rapid antigen tests are less likely to accurately diagnose current COVID infection than PCR tests.</p></li></ul><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">To be frank, the fact that Americans cannot access free and low-cost testing unless it&rsquo;s deemed <q>medically necessary</q> is a national scandal. Imagine how much better our economy and mental health could be if we had access to frequent testing to help us return to work safely or put visiting relatives at ease. Lack of leadership and ignorance have created a culture of scarcity around testing.</p><p class="p4">With a vaccine on the horizon and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00220-x">President Biden&rsquo;s ambitious plan</a> to boost the nation&rsquo;s testing capacity, there is light at the end of the tunnel. But right now, we&rsquo;re still in the tunnel. Biden&rsquo;s plan to push rapid antigen tests, increase testing centers, and expand lab test processing is a better plan than we&rsquo;ve seen from the previous administration, but can he—meaning <em>we</em> as a nation—pull it off?</p><p class="p4">Until now, our healthcare system has failed to live up to its promises on COVID testing. And until that changes, our health and safety are ultimately in our own (hopefully well-washed) hands.</p></div>' }

In-person instruction supports academic and interpersonal development, while providing hands-on learning and fewer distractions (compared to online learning). According to a Gallup poll, nearly three in ten parents said their child has <q><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/20210608-impacts-of-covid19.pdf">experienced harm to their emotional or mental health</a>,</q> claiming that separation from teachers and classmates is the main cause.</p><p class="p4">On the other hand, studies show that <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#covid-19-children-adolescents">children are more commonly asymptomatic</a>, and it&rsquo;s estimated that over 50% of COVID-19 cases are transmitted by people <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/asymptomatic-coronavirus-infections-contribute-to-over-50-percent-of-spread">without symptoms</a>. Even without symptoms, testing identifies infected people—making regular screenings an important strategy for teachers, staff, and students in areas of moderate to high transmission.</p><p class="p4">In-person learning is safe when accompanied by stringent protocols and continuous monitoring. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#covid-19-children-adolescents">Case studies</a> have demonstrated that in-person learning is not associated with an increased spread of COVID-19 when community transmission is low. However, cases in schools did increase at moderate-to-high levels of community transmission rates.</p><p class="p4">Although the rate of severe outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, mortality) amongst K-12 age groups are lower, youth who belong to some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected.</p><p class="p4">For example, a higher proportion of COVID-19 cases amongst BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, (and) People of Color) children resulted in hospitalization than among White children. Therefore, school sponsored COVID-19 testing programs create equitable access that builds confidence within communities.</p><h3 class="h3" id="other-risks">Other Risks</h3><h4 class="h4" id="variants">Variants</h4><p class="p4">Viruses constantly mutate and variants are expected. To date, there are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">variants of concern</a> of COVID-19, some stronger and more transmissible than others. The first variant to raise expert alarm was Delta, and more recently Omicron.</p><p class="p4">COVID-19 variants increase danger, especially for at-risk populations. To slow the emergence of new variants, reducing the spread is critical, which will be far more difficult if animal populations are now an increased concern.</p><p class="p4"><em>To learn more about the COVID-19 variants, check out our blog article, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">What you need to know about new COVID variants</a></em>.</p><h4 class="h4" id="long-term-impacts">Long-term Impacts</h4><p class="p4">Most people who contract COVID-19 recover within weeks of illness, but some experience post-COVID conditions. As more people in the U.S. recover from COVID-19, researchers and physicians observed that some survivors, including children, experience prolonged after effects such as: long-lasting fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, lung problems, joint pain, brain fog and other symptoms.

With President Joe Biden&rsquo;s <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/politics/biden-merck-johnson--johnson-vaccine/index.html">announcement that we will have enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May</a>, we have reason for hope while folks are waiting to be able to access the vaccine.</p><p class="p4">We are in a race between vaccination and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">variant mutations</a>. The longer it takes to get people vaccinated, the more likely <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/02/covid-19-vaccine-golden-rule/618140/">mutations will emerge, as the virus rages amongst communities</a>. Winning the race means vaccinating the overwhelming majority of the world population. So far, studies show that that the current vaccines are providing protection against the variants.</p><p class="p4">The good news is that every vaccination moves us closer as a nation to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19">herd immunity</a>. But in the meantime, we need to know how much it&rsquo;s safe to ease up on our precautionary behaviors. This blog post will help clarify what you can and can&rsquo;t do once you&rsquo;re fully vaccinated.</p><h3 class="h3">Getting the Vaccine</h3><p class="p4">Congrats, you&rsquo;ve made the wise choice to trust some of the best informed virologists and medical experts in the country, also known as the Centers for Disease Control! These vaccines are our best and most effective tool to fight COVID-19 and limit the spread of the virus and its <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/covid-variants">new variants</a>.</p><p class="p4">For most vaccines, full protection comes two weeks <em>after</em> receiving your second dose of the vaccine. (Be sure to follow the specific instructions for the vaccine you receive.) It takes this long for your body to build the necessary protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p class="p4">Because it&rsquo;s possible to become infected with the virus in the interim time between receiving the vaccine and building up immunity, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">you still need to practice prevention</a>.</p><p class="p4">Once vaccinated, it&rsquo;s still possible (though less likely) to catch the virus and potentially pass it to others. In the unlikely event that you are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, your symptoms will be greatly reduced. The vaccine drastically reduces your chances of becoming seriously ill, but it doesn&rsquo;t totally prevent infection.</p><p class="p4">So keep washing those hands, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://testthepeople.org">test strategically</a>, wear a mask, and watch for symptoms. And remember: even though the vaccine doesn&rsquo;t confer complete immunity, you are far better off confronting the virus and the world once you&rsquo;ve been fully vaccinated.</p><h3 class="h3">So what <em>can</em> we do?</h3><p class="p4">As per the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">CDC&rsquo;s most recent suggestions</a>, as long as you don&rsquo;t <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624100047.htm">show symptoms</a>, fully vaccinated people can:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Gather with other fully vaccinated people indoors and maskless without physical distancing</p></li><li><p class="p4">Avoid having to quarantine or be tested after exposure to the virus</p></li><li><p class="p4">Gather with unvaccinated members of a single household without distancing or wearing a mask, if that household has a low risk of severe disease.</p></li><li><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">Travel domestically without having to get tested before and after travel</a></p></li></ul><h3 class="h3">What not to do</h3><p class="p4">We suggest you avoid the urge to slap a <q>Just Vaxxed&rsquo;</q> sticker on your sore arm, rip off your mask, and run towards the nearest crowded dance floor.</p><p class="p4">Seriously though: getting a vaccine isn&rsquo;t a <q>get out of COVID free</q> card. It&rsquo;s more like a bulletproof vest: you might still get hit, but you&rsquo;re less likely to bite the big one in case the worst happens.</p><p class="p4">Also, we&rsquo;re still a long way off from knowing exactly how effective the vaccines are against the new mutations of the virus. For now, your safest course of action after getting vaccinated is to continue practicing prevention, while respecting the reality it will take some time for the majority of the population to be vaccinated.</p><p class="p4">Even once you&rsquo;re vaccinated, it&rsquo;s important to avoid:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">Unmasked and undistanced gathering with high-risk populations like unvaccinated elders and others with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fgroups-at-higher-risk.html">underlying conditions that make getting COVID more serious</a></p></li><li><p class="p4">Large crowds</p></li><li><p class="p4">Gathering indoors with unvaccinated folks from multiple households</p></li></ul><p class="p4">If you&rsquo;re hosting a small cocktail party to celebrate with a fully vaccinated friend, congrats and enjoy! But if your unvaccinated neighbor shows up, it&rsquo;s probably best to mask up and take the party outdoors. Also, having vaccination parties might be uncool, considering not everyone gets access to the vaccine at the same rate—so be discreet.</p><h3 class="h3">To sum up</h3><p class="p4">Things are changing, yet again and hopefully for the better. Depending on your location and community, you may be seeing more and more people relax their vigilance and precautions. You might also be chuckling with angst about how some of them never followed those precautions in the first place—and for that, we feel you.</p><p class="p4">But we think it&rsquo;s too early to throw our hands up and <q>go back to normal</q>—and the CDC agrees. There are benefits to relaxing some of the most restrictive social distancing measures, but now is not the time to disregard them all. In public settings, vaccinated people still need to continue to follow all public health precautions.</p><p class="p4">Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a gesture of mutual respect and consideration to empathize with and protect the health of the most vulnerable in any private or public setting. We won&rsquo;t weather this pandemic through science alone, but by doing our best to be respectful, considerate, and patient under the most trying of times. Even when you&rsquo;re seeing the light at the tunnel, it&rsquo;s important to keep up the good work until everyone has made it through to the other side.</p></div>' }

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><p class="p4">When renegade.bio held its first no-cost COVID-19 testing at San Francisco&rsquo;s Pride Is a Riot rally in Dolores Park in June 2020, our goal was to provide a resource to underserved communities in the Bay Area to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 testing for disease prevention.</p><p class="p4">Data collected from that event showed 44 percent of the people we tested never had a COVID-19 test before. We considered that a measure of success. But the majority of those tested were white and had received a COVID-19 test prior to our event. While we reached some of the communities we set out to assist, such as the LGBTQ+ community, we hadn&rsquo;t reached others, such as people of color, the unhoused and other disenfranchised populations.</p><figure class=" w-richtext-align-floatleft"><div class="image-container"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/renegade-bio/image/upload/newsroom/publications/rethinking-diagnostics-to-reduce-healthcare-disparities/covid-testing-solutions-follow-up-line.jpg" width="1600" height="848" title="r.bio Pride is a Riot testing event, San Francisco Mission, June 2020" alt="People waiting in line for COVID testing" loading="lazy" alt="People in line for COVID testing"></div><figcaption>r.bio <em>Pride is a Riot</em> testing event, San Francisco Mission, June 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="p4">This was a turning point for us. We realized we needed to identify and address not only traditional barriers to access to care for marginalized communities—such as income, socioeconomic status, access to technology and transportation—but more complex barriers such as deep-seeded mistrust, disenfranchisement and a lack of healthcare education.</p><p class="p4">In response, we reached out to the California Department of Health as well as community based organizations that are deeply embedded and trusted sources among underserved communities to better understand how we could meet the communities&rsquo; needs. This proved vital to our understanding. For example, when we learned from our partner Umoja Health that Black communities were skeptical of nasal swabs, we offered to collect test samples through saliva. Meeting the community where it was at resulted in increased trust and participation, and ultimately better health outcomes.</p><p class="p4">This approach to develop strategic community partnerships has shaped our mission as a public benefit corporation that steps beyond the function of a laboratory and travels the entire journey of access, education, testing and treatment with those we serve. It informs where we set up our collection sites and where we&rsquo;ll set up future labs as well. When we hear of communities with limited to no access to testing, we reach out, just as we did with Alameda, California, where we established our most recent COVID-19 testing site.</p><p class="p4">But everyone needs access to testing, regardless of income and socioeconomic status. Our agility and ability to quickly adapt to meet the unique needs of communities has enabled us to serve an incredibly diverse population from underserved communities to members of the United Nations who needed a time-sensitive, customized testing solution. As COVID-19 testing slows, we&rsquo;re using our experience and knowledge learned during the pandemic to expand our clinical diagnostics to multi-panel testing. Due to the pandemic, the field of clinical diagnostics—an antiquated industry—is undergoing a revolution as new methodologies make it possible to develop widely accessible, rapid, accurate, low-cost testing solutions that inform medical decision-making in a timely manner.</p><p class="p4">How do we select which tests we develop? We look at where there&rsquo;s a lack of attention—specifically among underserved communities—and how we can bridge the gap between science and healthcare education through community partnerships to empower change. We see reproductive and sexual health as one area of healthcare that urgently needs attention.</p><figure><div class="image-container"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/renegade-bio/image/upload/newsroom/publications/rethinking-diagnostics-to-reduce-healthcare-disparities/diagnostic-testing-laboratory-staff.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Lab testing personnel in renegade.bio’s Berkeley lab" alt="Lab testing personnel operates an automated system" loading="lazy" alt="Lab testing personnel operates an automated system"></div><figcaption>lab testing personnel in renegade.bio&rsquo;s Berkeley lab</figcaption></figure><p class="p4">In the near future we plan to release our rapid, low-cost preeclampsia test and expand access through partnerships with targeted community-based organizations to reach the most diverse populations that need access to this early diagnostic test. In 2021, the Biden Administration <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/07/fact-sheet-vice-president-kamala-harris-announces-call-to-action-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/">announced</a> its plans to <q>address the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis as a key priority,</q> and direct $3 billion toward the effort as part of the Build Back Better Act. The administration also noted <q>rates are among the highest in the developed world, and they are especially high among Black women and Native American women, regardless of their income or education levels.</q></p><p class="p4">An in-depth understanding of the populations we serve also informs the development of our tests. We can tune the algorithms of our assays to target specific biomarkers of the population being tested, for example, Black women, to calculate the corresponding disease risk. Not only do we offer a test that can help women understand their pregnancies more completely, we&rsquo;re making it accessible the same way we brought COVID-19 testing to our community, which has the potential to impact a large segment of the U.S. population.</p><p class="p4">Additionally, we see accessible diagnostics playing a vital role in local and national healthcare initiatives by implementing early detection and preventing the spread of disease. For example, San Francisco launched <q><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gettingtozerosf.org/about_gtz-start/#:~:text=Our%20Goals,their%20current%20levels%20by%202025.">Getting to Zero</a>,</q> an initiative to eradicate new cases of HIV, have zero HIV-related deaths and zero HIV stigma in the city by 2025. According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20estimated%20number,among%20all%20other%20age%20groups.">hiv.org</a>, Black communities make up 44 percent of all new HIV cases in the U.S. and gay men make up 69 percent of all new HIV cases in the country.</p><p class="p4">Early diagnostics coupled with community outreach among underserved communities can support this initiative. We have the capacity to educate populations that have a high propensity to transmit HIV. This includes sex workers, unhoused populations, users of IV drugs and communities that traditionally do not discuss sexually transmitted diseases. Diagnostics and education helps individuals understand what it means for them and what they can do to stay safe.</p><p class="p4">It&rsquo;s our goal to make accessible testing mainstream nationwide. We believe the key to expanding that reach is through community partnerships and commitments to communities. To support that, we plan to open additional laboratories in the Midwest and the East Coast in 2023 to serve underrepresented populations that lack access to care and health education.</p><p class="p4">While the opportunities are ripe for emerging diagnostics to shape new standards of access to care, the role of state and federal government cannot be understated. As an organization, we continue to lobby for legislation that supports not only the rapid development of clinical diagnostics, but the inclusion of these tests as fundamental health care for all, as well as the funding to support them.</p></div>' }

      { content: '<div class="sub-section"><p class="p4">In this post, we are going to dive into the difference between types of COVID tests. This is important because different tests are appropriate for different circumstances, depending on accuracy, result time, and whether you may be currently or previously infected.</p><p class="p4">The science behind COVID-19 testing can be hard to decipher. We want to make it easy for you to decide which test is right for you by giving you the basic rundown on each type of test. By the end of this article you&rsquo;ll know more about what tests are available and which test is right for you.</p><h3 class="h3">Why get tested?</h3><p class="p4">Generally, people get tested for reasons like these:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li><p class="p4">To diagnose illness after suspected exposure</p></li><li><p class="p4">To help confirm non-infection before travel or other event</p></li><li><p class="p4">To keep ourselves and our community healthy by tracking the spread of the virus</p></li></ul><p class="p4">The CDC recommends testing for COVID-19 if you have <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> with someone with positive diagnosis, or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"> if you are showing symptoms.</a></p><h3 class="h3">PCR testing</h3><h4 class="h4">What it is</h4><p class="p4">Also known as a qRT-PCR test (real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) or NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test), this type of molecular diagnostic test confirms current infection by detecting the presence of genetic material from the virus that causes COVID-19. PCR tests are effective because they are able to detect very small concentrations of the virus other tests might not catch.</p><h4 class="h4">How it works</h4><p class="p4">PCR tests replicate the DNA or RNA of the viral genetic material in your body and test it against a control sample of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab. Often samples will be taken via a pharyngeal aka nasal swab. Lucky for us, there are next generation tests available that have high concordance and efficiency using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/diagnostic-testing/about-our-saliva-covid-test">a saliva sample.</a></p><p class="p4">This test is least accurate immediately after exposure to the virus. For greatest accuracy, you should isolate for five to seven days before being tested.</p><h4 class="h4">Why use it</h4><p class="p4">PCR testing is the most accurate type of test available. Results are generally available within one to three days.</p><h3 class="h3">Antigen testing</h3><h4 class="h4">What it is</h4><p class="p4"><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html#:~:text=Antigen%20tests%20are%20immunoassays%20that,extraction%20buffer%20or%20reagent.">Antigen tests</a> look for the presence of detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection.</p><h4 class="h4">How it works</h4><p class="p4">It looks for a specific protein to indicate the presence of infection. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-12-31-20/h_1f88b08c1f45c6b04647f27fae73618b">Antigen testing is less accurate than PCR testing</a>. If you test positive initially with this kind of test, you will need to get a confirmatory PCR test.</p><h4 class="h4">Why use it</h4><p class="p4">Antigen tests are rapid, often providing results in minutes. They are less expensive than PCR tests. Some antigen tests have been approved <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/treatment/coronavirus-test">for testing as home kits.</a></p><h3 class="h3">Antibody testing</h3><h4 class="h4">What it is</h4><p class="p4">An <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/antibody-serology-testing-covid-19-information-patients-and-consumers"><strong>antibody test</strong> </a>, also known as a serology test, finds proteins made in your body in response to previous infection or from vaccination for COVID-19. There are neutralizing antibodies which defend our bodies from infection and non-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies which do not.</p><p class="p4">Antibody tests cannot diagnose current infection.</p><h4 class="h4">How it works</h4><p class="p4">Your blood is tested for proteins created by your body&rsquo;s immune system soon after you have been infected or vaccinated.</p><h4 class="h4">Why use it</h4><p class="p4">If you&rsquo;re traveling to China, you will need a total antibody test which tests for both kinds of antibodies neutralizing and non-neutralizing.</p><p class="p4">If you are trying to determine if you have potential immunity or whether you have been infected in the past you will need a neutralizing antibody assay.</p><p class="p4">Even if you do have COVID-19 antibodies, we do not know yet if this provides any length of immunity. Please continue to take <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"><strong>these safety precautions</strong></a> seriously.</p><h3 class="h3">Compare the tests</h3><h4 class="h4">What if the test is inaccurate?</h4><p class="p4">You may be wondering why use tests that don&rsquo;t provide 100% accuracy. The simple answer is that no such test exists. We need to combine medical care with observation, common sense, and updated information for our best chances at staying healthy.</p><p class="p4">Test accuracy is influenced by the type of test and when you were tested relative to your exposure. For a deeper dive into the accuracy of each test, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734">visit Harvard Health.</a></p><h4 class="h4">False positives</h4><p class="p4">Sometimes the test tells us we have COVID-19 when we actually don&rsquo;t. These false results are generally due to human error or lab contamination. If you receive a positive test result from any type of test, get <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.testthepeople.org">a confirmatory PCR test immediately</a>.</p><h4 class="h4">False negatives</h4><p class="p4">More commonly, a test indicates we are not infected with COVID-19 when we might actually be. These sometimes occur when there is not enough virus in a given sample for the test to be accurate.</p><p class="p4">The COVID-19 virus takes several days to incubate in your system before it can be reliably tested with either the PCR or the antigen test. It is best to get tested three to five days after known exposure. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.renegade.bio/articles/get-the-right-test-at-the-right-time">We talk more about the viral time-table here.</a></p><h3 class="h3" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p class="p4">Now you know that PCR testing is the gold standard for COVID diagnostic testing, with the highest accuracy available. Both PCR and antigen testing identify current infection. Generally, you want to seek out a PCR test and settle for an antigen test in its absence.</p><p class="p4">Use an antibody test to confirm prior infection. Remember you may not have developed antibodies, and even if you did it might not confirm immunity.</p><p class="p4">In the USA, tests must be ordered by your healthcare provider.
